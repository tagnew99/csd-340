        <h2>Chapter 1: All About Me</h2>
        <p class="intro">Hello! My name is Tanner, and I would like to share some details about my life. In the next 3 small paragraphs, I'll breakdown my childhood and relationship with my family, the romantic relationship I'm currently in, and one of my favorite hobbies of all time. While I realize this is mostly fluff to fill out a document page, I hope it offers some kind of entertainment!.</p>
        <p>My family live close by and all are well. I am the youngest of three, my two older siblings both being sisters. My mom and dad are still very close, and I was raised in a very family-centric upbringing. Like many people, but especially young men, I sought distance from my family and craved independence for years in my late teens and early twenties.</p>
        <p>I owe my current relationship with my family, which has been rekindled as we are becoming quite close again, to my girlfriend. My girlfriend and I have been together for about 6 months now, and they have been some of the greatest months of my life. Her name is Nicole, and while it is only my second relationship, I have no doubts that it will be a lasting one. She has taught me so much, and I am incredibly grateful for her.</p>
        <p> One of my favorite hobbies is playing Dungeons and Dragons. More specifically, I enjoy playing the Game Master, running and facilitating games for my friends to play. My old friend group moved away, but I want to play using an online software that I just need to find the time to learn, and then I hope we can pick up where we left off. In the meantime, I may start a new game for some friends at work!</p>
