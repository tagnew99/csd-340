	        <li>How much work goes into building the structure of a web page</li>
	        <li>That you can build a webpage with simple software like Notepad or any other text editor, I assumed it would need a more complex program to run</li>
	        <li>How social psychology actually plays into web design far more than I realized, and how much designers think about their web designs from a sales/consumer standpoint rather than purely aesthetics</li>
	        <li>Organization methods for alternating between folder-based memory and online storage like Github</li>
